# monitor_ticket_queue
This script will continuously monitor the ticket queue for new tickets, add a time entry of one hour to each new ticket, update the status to 'Resolved', and display a running indicator. It will log the actions taken and the number of tickets processed, updating the line in place to avoid repeated prints.
